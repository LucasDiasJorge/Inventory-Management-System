# Assignment (Inventory Management System)

# Step 1: Review the Design Challenges

I've chosen the Inventory Management System challenge. The goal is to create a console application where users can manage product stock. Key features include:

1. Add new products with name, price, and stock quantity.

2. Update stock when products are sold or restocked.

3. View all products and their stock levels.

4. Remove products from inventory.

# Step 2: Define the Project Requirements and Objectives

## Functional Requirements

1. Add Product: Allow the user to input a productï¿½s name, price, and stock quantity.

2. Update Stock: Allow the user to increase or decrease the stock quantity of a product.

3. View Products: Display a list of all products with their details (name, price, stock).

4. Remove Product: Allow the user to remove a product from the inventory.

5. Menu System: Provide a menu for users to select actions (add, update, view, remove, exit).

## Non-Functional Requirements

1. User-Friendly Interface: The console application should be easy to navigate.

2. Error Handling: The application should handle invalid inputs gracefully.

3. Scalability: The code should be modular and easy to extend in the future.

## Project Objectives

1. Create a functional console application that meets the requirements.

2. Write clean, well-structured, and documented code.

3. Demonstrate the use of control structures, loops, and methods.

# Step 3: Create a Design Outline

## Tasks and Code Components

### Main Menu:

- Display options (Add, Update, View, Remove, Exit).

- Use a switch statement to handle user input.

### Add Product:

- Prompt the user for product details (name, price, stock).

- Store the product in a list or dictionary.

- Use a while loop to allow adding multiple products.

### Update Stock:

- Prompt the user for the product name and the quantity to add/remove.

- Use an if-else statement to validate the product exists.

- Update the stock quantity.

### View Products:

- Loop through the list of products and display their details.

### Remove Product:

- Prompt the user for the product name.

- Use an if statement to validate the product exists.

- Remove the product from the list.

### Exit:

- Exit the application.

# Step 4: Build the application
